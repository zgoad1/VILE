## Bugs

**- A -**

**- B -**
- Sprinting sometimes doesn't make you invincible
- CR's animation places it at origin
- Reticle/targeting does not work when the enemy approaches the center of the screen from a distance
- turning does not use deltatime
- sprinting into a corner can clip you through the wall
- Unpossessing enemies whilst attacking with them was problematic and given a hasty fix
- sprinting out of an enemy still doesn't always align you with the direction you're facing

**- C -**
- you can sometimes attack while falling from Attack1d and it sometimes triggers an extra landing animation (land is triggered during Attack1a)
- the tunnel is a bug says tristan
