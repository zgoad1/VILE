## Bugs

**- A -**

**- B -**
- Reticle sometimes disappears forever 
- turning does not use deltatime
- Unpossessing enemies whilst attacking with them was problematic and given a hasty fix
- sprinting out of an enemy still doesn't always align you with the direction you're facing

**- C -**
- Start room lighting is wacky in build
- Killing the FlashEye causes Tess to spark
- Animation messes up occasionally when coming out of lightning bolt
