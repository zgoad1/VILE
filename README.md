## Bugs

**- A -**

**- B -**
- Reticle sometimes disappears forever
- Flash eye's PlayerUpdate is wacky (no deltatime, can't stop)
- turning does not use deltatime
- Unpossessing enemies whilst attacking with them was problematic and given a hasty fix
- sprinting out of an enemy still doesn't always align you with the direction you're facing

**- C -**
