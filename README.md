## Bugs

**- A -**

**- B -**
- Reticle/targeting does not work when the enemy approaches the center of the screen from a distance
- Reticle sometimes disappears forever? 
- turning does not use deltatime
- Unpossessing enemies whilst attacking with them was problematic and given a hasty fix
- sprinting out of an enemy still doesn't always align you with the direction you're facing

**- C -**
- the tunnel is a bug says tristan
- Spamming attacks will cause an extra land animation to play
- Animation messes up occasionally when coming out of lightning bolt
