Map Generator:
Have different area types, like "biomes." Separated by doors of type "TRANSITION." something like

enum roomType {
	HALLS, TRANSITION, TUNNELS, OFFICES
}

// used in determining if we can connect r2 to r1
bool TypeMatch(Room r1, Room r2) {
	if(r1.type == TRANSITION || r2.type == TRANSITION return true;
	return r1.type == r2.type;
}

Might need different types of exit rooms for each environment.
