ADDING ENEMIES:
- GroundTest should be placed at "feet"
- Make sure GroundTest intersects ground when enemy is "standing"
- GroundTest layer should be changed to character's layer
- Need a TargetableRenderer on whatever object has the main mesh renderer
- Remember to move the CamLook to the proper location

ADDING DYINGENEMIES:
- Read/write must be enabled on the model or mesh colliders will not work in builds
